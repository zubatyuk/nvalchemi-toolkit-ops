# Neighbor Lists

Neighbor lists enumerate atom pairs within a cutoff distance. ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops
provides GPU-accelerated neighbor list algorithms via
[NVIDIA Warp](https://nvidia.github.io/warp/) with bindings for both PyTorch and JAX.

```{tip}
Start with the unified `neighbor_list` function
({func}`~nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors.neighbor_list` for PyTorch,
{func}`~nvalchemiops.jax.neighbors.neighbor_list` for JAX).
It automatically selects the best algorithm for your system size and handles
both single and batched inputs.
```

## Why Neighbor Lists Matter for Performance

Neighbor list construction can dominate runtime when called repeatedly:

- **Naive algorithms scale as $O(N^2)$**: Checking all atom pairs becomes
  prohibitive for systems with a large number of atoms. The "~2000 atoms"
  figures used below are illustrative only — the actual `naive`/`cell_list`
  crossover is decided per system by the geometry cost model (see the
  Method Dispatch section), not a fixed atom count.
- **Repeated construction**: callers that rebuild lists every step pay this
  cost on each call
- **Memory bandwidth**: Large neighbor matrices can bottleneck GPU throughput

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops addresses these costs with O(N) cell-list algorithms, a
cluster-pair tile algorithm for large fully-periodic float32 inputs, efficient
batch processing for heterogeneous inputs, and memory layouts optimized for
GPU access patterns. See [performance considerations](nl_performance) for
guidance.

## Quick Start

The `neighbor_list` function provides a unified interface that automatically
dispatches to the optimal algorithm based on system size and whether batch
indices are provided.

```{note}
When `method` is not specified, `neighbor_list` automatically selects by
comparing the estimated work of `naive`, `cell_list`, and `cluster_tile`,
computed from per-system geometry (atom counts and cell / bounding-box volumes)
rather than atom count alone.  The `naive`↔`cell_list` crossover is governed by the number of
cutoff-sized cells `V / cutoff**3` (atom count and density cancel out of the
per-system ratio): small or dense systems use `naive`, larger sparse systems
use `cell_list`.  This avoids routing large high-cutoff systems to the
$O(N^2)$ path.  Auto-dispatch also considers `cluster_tile` for feasible
CUDA float32 fully-periodic workloads with compatible outputs and contiguous
batch metadata.  The same estimate is exposed publicly via
`suggest_neighbor_list_method` / `estimate_neighbor_list_costs` (see
[Estimating and Running a Strategy Explicitly](#estimating-and-running-a-strategy-explicitly));
call one once on per-system
geometry (`batch_ptr`, `cell`, `pbc`, `cutoff`) and reuse the returned strategy
name explicitly when repeated calls should avoid auto-dispatch syncs.  The
crossover constants are env-overridable (`NVALCHEMI_NEIGHLIST_CELL_SHELL`,
`NVALCHEMI_NEIGHLIST_CELL_SETUP`)---benchmark your workload and recalibrate if
needed.
```

## Data Formats

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops supports two output formats for neighbor data:

Neighbor Matrix (default)
: Fixed-size array of shape `(num_atoms, max_neighbors)` where each row
  contains the neighbor indices for that atom, padded with a fill value.
  Returns `(neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, neighbor_matrix_shifts)`.

Neighbor List (COO format)
: Sparse array of shape `(2, num_pairs)` containing `[source_atoms, target_atoms]`.
  Returns `(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr, neighbor_list_shifts)` where
  `neighbor_ptr` is a CSR-style pointer array. The first set of atoms (nominally
  `source_atoms`) is guaranteed to be sorted.

### When to Use Each Format

**Neighbor Matrix** is preferred when:

- Using `torch.compile` or `jax.jit` (fixed memory layout avoids graph breaks)
- Systems have dense, uniform neighbor distributions
- Cache-friendly access patterns are important

**Neighbor List (COO)** is preferred when:

- Integrating with graph neural network libraries (PyG, DGL)
- Systems are sparse with highly variable neighbors per atom
- Memory efficiency is critical

### Switching Formats

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} PyTorch

# Get COO format directly
neighbor_list_coo, neighbor_ptr, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc, return_neighbor_list=True

# Or convert from matrix format
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors.neighbor_utils import get_neighbor_list_from_neighbor_matrix

neighbor_list_coo, neighbor_ptr, shifts_coo = get_neighbor_list_from_neighbor_matrix(
    neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, neighbor_matrix_shifts, fill_value=num_atoms
)
```

:::

# Get COO format directly

    positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc, return_neighbor_list=True
)

# Or convert from matrix format

neighbor_list_coo, neighbor_ptr, shifts_coo = get_neighbor_list_from_neighbor_matrix(
    neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, neighbor_matrix_shifts, fill_value=num_atoms
)
```

:::

::::

```{warning}
Setting `return_neighbor_list=True` incurs a conversion overhead. If you need
both formats, compute the matrix format first and convert as needed.
```

```{note}
With PyTorch >=2.10, exact COO conversion supports
`torch.compile(fullgraph=True)` when the edge count changes. Exact sizing via
`nonzero` may synchronize the host. Capacity overflow raises
`NeighborOverflowError` in eager execution and an asynchronous runtime error
in compiled execution.
```

## Method Dispatch

### Method and Strategy

`method` is the high-level `neighbor_list(...)` selector. A family method such as
`method="naive"` or `method="cell_list"` chooses the neighbor-list algorithm family
and lets that family choose its direct strategy automatically. A strategy-pinned
method such as `method="naive_tile"` or `method="cell_list_pair_centric"` chooses
both the algorithm family and the direct strategy.

`neighbor_list(..., method="naive")` does not resolve to `"scalar"` or `"tile"` in
the high-level dispatcher. It forwards `strategy="auto"` to the direct naive
implementation, where the scalar/tile strategy is selected.

`cluster_tile` and `batch_cluster_tile` are complete high-level methods with a
single implementation. There is no `strategy` choice available for them.

`strategy` is only for direct algorithm calls such as `naive_neighbor_list(...)` or
`cell_list(...)`. For direct naive calls, `strategy` selects `"auto"`, `"scalar"`,
or `"tile"`. For direct cell-list calls, `strategy` selects `"auto"`,
`"atom_centric"`, or `"pair_centric"`.

Use `method=` when calling `neighbor_list(...)`. Use `strategy=` only when calling
a direct algorithm function.

Strategy-pinned high-level methods:

```python
neighbor_list(positions, cutoff, method="naive_tile")
neighbor_list(positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc, method="cell_list_pair_centric")
```

Direct algorithm strategy:

```python
naive_neighbor_list(positions, cutoff, strategy="tile")
cell_list(positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc, strategy="pair_centric")
```

When `method=None`, `neighbor_list` selects an algorithm using the following
logic:

1. If `cutoff2` is provided, choose the dual-cutoff naive method.
2. Otherwise, build per-system geometry (`batch_ptr`, `cell`, `pbc`); cell-less
   inputs synthesize a bounding-box cell purely for the cost estimate.
3. Compare the guarded geometry cost of `"naive"`, `"cell_list"`, and
   `"cluster_tile"` (the last only when its CUDA / float32 / fully-periodic
   guards pass); choose the lowest-cost feasible base method.
4. If `batch_idx` or `batch_ptr` is provided for more than one system, prepend
   `"batch_"` to the method.

The chosen method is honored as-is.  For a **cell-less** COO call
(`return_neighbor_list=True` with no `cell`) the return arity is therefore
method-dependent: `"naive"` returns a 2-tuple `(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr)`
(non-periodic, no shifts), while `"cell_list"` synthesizes a non-PBC cell and
returns a 3-tuple `(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr, shifts)` with zeroed shifts.
Pass an explicit `cell`+`pbc` (or use the matrix format) for a stable 3-tuple.

(estimating-and-running-a-strategy-explicitly)=

### Estimating and running a strategy explicitly

The same cost model is exposed as a public estimation API on all three backends
(`nvalchemiops.neighbors`, `nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors`,
`nvalchemiops.jax.neighbors`).  `estimate_neighbor_list_costs` returns every
feasible strategy with its relative estimated cost (lower is faster), sorted
cheapest-first, and `suggest_neighbor_list_method` returns just the top name:

```python
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import (
    estimate_neighbor_list_costs,
    suggest_neighbor_list_method,
)

estimate_neighbor_list_costs(batch_ptr, cell, pbc, cutoff=6.0)
# -> [("cell_list_pair_centric", 2.1e6), ("naive_tile", 3.2e6), ...]

method = suggest_neighbor_list_method(batch_ptr, cell, pbc, cutoff=6.0)
# -> e.g. "cell_list_pair_centric"  (a "batch_..." name when num_systems > 1)
```

The strategy names are the fine-grained, directly-runnable paths
(`naive_tile`, `naive_scalar`, `cell_list_pair_centric`,
`cell_list_atom_centric`, `cluster_tile`, plus `batch_` variants).  `suggest`
and `estimate` **synchronize on the host** -- they launch a tiny selector kernel
on the device and read its result back, so call them outside `torch.compile` /
`jax.jit`.  The returned name is accepted directly as `method=`, so the compiled
neighbor build runs without a graph break:

```python
neighbor_list(positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc, method=method)
```

#### Interpreting the cost estimate

The costs are **relative**, in arbitrary units: only their ordering matters, so
compare them to each other, not to a wall-clock time.  Each value is a closed
form derived from the geometry (atom counts, cell volume, cutoff, periodic
images) that approximates the dominant kernel work for that strategy -- the
candidate pairs scanned, the neighbors written, and the per-launch overhead.
A strategy that fails a feasibility guard (for example `cluster_tile` on a
non-periodic or non-float32 input) is omitted from the result entirely rather
than returned with a large cost.

```{note}
The estimate is a hardware-independent model of *algorithmic* work; it does not
measure your GPU.  The true crossover between strategies shifts with the device
(memory bandwidth, occupancy, launch overhead), so on a given machine the
predicted best strategy may be marginally slower than a close runner-up.  The
ranking is reliable for the large gaps that matter (avoiding an $O(N^2)$ blow-up
on a big system); for cases where the top costs are within a small factor,
benchmark the top few candidates on your target hardware and pass the winner as
`method=` explicitly.  Two calibration constants are env-overridable:
`NVALCHEMI_NEIGHLIST_CELL_SHELL` (default `27.0`, the cell-list neighbor-shell work
multiplier — roughly the `3x3x3` stencil of cells scanned per atom) and
`NVALCHEMI_NEIGHLIST_CELL_SETUP` (default `4096.0`, the cell-list build/setup cost
floor).  Raising `CELL_SETUP` biases the model toward `naive` for smaller systems;
lowering it favors `cell_list`.
```

### Available Methods

`method=` accepts the family method names below and the strategy-pinned method
names returned by `suggest_neighbor_list_method` / `estimate_neighbor_list_costs`.
Family methods resolve to a default direct strategy (`"naive"` → scalar,
`"cell_list"` → atom-centric); prefix any name with `batch_` for multi-system
batched inputs.

| Method | Algorithm | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `"naive"`, `"naive_scalar"` | $O(N^2)$ scalar pairwise | Small single systems |
| `"naive_tile"` | $O(N^2)$ tiled CUDA kernel | Small single systems on GPU |
| `"cell_list"`, `"cell_list_atom_centric"` | $O(N)$ spatial decomposition, one thread per atom | Large single systems |
| `"cell_list_pair_centric"` | $O(N)$ cell list, one thread per candidate pair | Large, high-parallelism systems |
| `"cluster_tile"` | Cluster-pair tile (CUDA, float32, fully periodic) | Large single systems on GPU |
| `"naive_dual_cutoff"` | $O(N^2)$ with two cutoffs | Two-cutoff queries |
| `"batch_*"` | Per-system batched form of any of the above (e.g. `"batch_cell_list"`, `"batch_cluster_tile"`, `"batch_naive_dual_cutoff"`) | Batched systems |

Method names that do not start with `batch_` refer to single-system algorithms.
When `batch_idx` or `batch_ptr` (batch metadata) is supplied, those explicit
method names are treated as aliases for the corresponding `batch_*` methods.
For example, `method="naive"` is dispatched as `method="batch_naive"` when batch
metadata is provided.

(naive-algorithm)=

## Naive Algorithm

The naive algorithm enumerates every $N(N-1)/2$ atom pair, computes the Euclidean
distance under the active periodic boundary conditions, and keeps pairs within the
cutoff. With no spatial data structure it has the lowest setup overhead, which makes
it the right choice for small single systems (illustratively below ~2000 atoms; the
cost model decides) and for batches of small heterogeneous systems via `batch_naive`.
It supports periodic boundaries (with or without pre-wrapped positions), half-fill,
inline pair-potential evaluation through `pair_fn`, and — through the separate
`naive_dual_cutoff` variant — dual cutoff.

(cell-list-algorithm)=

## Cell-List Algorithm

The cell-list algorithm bins atoms into spatial cells aligned to the simulation box
and enumerates pairs only between neighboring cells, scaling as $O(N)$ for roughly
uniform neighbor counts. It is the default when the cost model estimates it cheaper
than `naive`. It supports periodic boundaries with arbitrary (including triclinic)
cells, half-fill, partial lists (`target_indices`), and inline pair-potential
evaluation through `pair_fn`; build and query are separate launchers so the bin
structure can be cached across steps (see [Build/Query Separation](#build-query-separation)).
It has no
dual-cutoff variant — use `naive_dual_cutoff` for two-cutoff queries.

The query has two CUDA kernel strategies, `atom_centric` (default) and `pair_centric`,
chosen with `strategy="auto"` or pinned explicitly; both produce identical pair sets
(only per-row ordering differs) and are available on PyTorch and JAX. On the fast
path, `pair_centric` schedules one CUDA block per `(source_cell, neighbor offset)`;
when that uncoarsened launch would exceed the Warp one-dimensional limit, the
launcher transparently coarsens multiple logical blocks per CUDA block under the
same strategy name (no new public method or `strategy` value). On JAX,
`pair_centric` is bound through `jax_callable`, sizes its launch from the host, and
requires `graph_mode="none"` (it raises under `jax.jit` with a traced radius; use
`atom_centric` there).

(cluster-pair-tile-algorithm)=

## Cluster-Pair Tile Algorithm

The cluster-pair tile algorithm is a CUDA-only build strategy that groups atoms into
Morton-sorted tiles and queries pairs cooperatively per tile, targeting large
fully-periodic float32 systems where the cell-list build overhead is unfavorable.
`neighbor_list(method=None)` auto-selects it when eligible; force it with
`method="cluster_tile"` / `"batch_cluster_tile"`.

It requires float32 positions on a CUDA device, a provided `cell` with `pbc` true on
all three axes, `half_fill=False`, and no `target_indices`; unsupported output
combinations raise a clear `ValueError` or `NotImplementedError`. Build and query are
separate launchers
({func}`~nvalchemiops.neighbors.cluster_tile.build_cluster_tile_list` /
{func}`~nvalchemiops.neighbors.cluster_tile.query_cluster_tile`, with bindings under
`nvalchemiops.{jax,torch}.neighbors.cluster_tile`), so the tiles can be cached across
steps; batched workflows accept `rebuild_flags` to re-enumerate only systems whose
atoms moved beyond the skin distance. Dual cutoff is supported in matrix format but
cannot be combined with pair-potential outputs.

(cluster-tile-buffer-capacity)=

### Tile-buffer capacity

Cluster-tile construction divides each system into groups of at most 32 atoms.
A system with $N$ atoms has $\lceil N/32\rceil$ groups. Groups do not
cross system boundaries, so a compact batch containing systems of sizes $N_i$
has $g=\sum_i\lceil N_i/32\rceil$ groups in total.

The build stores discovered tile pairs in one buffer shared by all row groups.
If `max_tiles_per_group` is $m$, a compact build with $g$ groups reserves
$C=g\,\min(g,m)$ records. Increasing $m$ by one adds $g$ records until $m$
reaches $g$; larger values do not increase the allocation. Each record contains
two `int32` group indices, so the tile-index arrays use $8C$ bytes for one
system. A compact batch also records the system index and uses $12C$ bytes.
Other scratch buffers and the neighbor output do not depend on $m$.

#### Choosing a capacity

`cluster_tile_neighbor_list` and `batch_cluster_tile_neighbor_list` construct
the tile list and query the neighbor output in the same call. During eager
execution, they call
{func}`~nvalchemiops.neighbors.cluster_tile.estimate_max_tiles_per_group` when
`max_tiles_per_group` is `None`. The estimator uses each system's atom count,
cell volume, and cutoff; its `safety` parameter adds headroom for uneven density
or changing geometries.

There are three ways to choose a capacity:

- Before execution, use the estimator for a heuristic based on the current
  geometry.
- After an eager overflow, use the reported tile count to calculate the exact
  requirement for that geometry.
- For a geometry-independent single-system bound, use the upper-triangular
  maximum of $g(g+1)/2$ tile pairs. This requires
  `max_tiles_per_group=ceil((g + 1) / 2)`.

Dual-cutoff sizing uses `max(cutoff, cutoff2)`. By convention, `cutoff2` is the
outer cutoff and is at least `cutoff`, but the cluster-tile convenience
functions accept either order. Use the same larger cutoff when calling the
estimator directly.

#### Recovering from eager overflow

`TileBufferOverflow` reports the required tile-pair count as
`error.num_tiles` and the allocated capacity as `error.max_tiles`. For a compact
single-system or batch build, the exact retry value for that geometry is

$$
m_{\mathrm{retry}} = \left\lceil\frac{\mathtt{error.num\_tiles}}{g}\right\rceil,
$$

where $g$ is the total group count for the compact build.

A segmented batch gives each system its own interval in the tile buffer. System
$i$ has capacity `tile_offsets[i + 1] - tile_offsets[i]` and reports its required
count in `tile_counts[i]`. The exact shared retry value for the current batch is

$$
m_{\mathrm{retry}} =
\max_{i:\,g_i>0}\left\lceil\frac{\mathtt{tile\_counts}[i]}{g_i}\right\rceil.
$$

For a trajectory, retain the largest observed requirement and add headroom for
later geometries. `TileBufferOverflow` reports exhaustion of the intermediate
tile-pair buffer. `NeighborOverflowError` reports that the final matrix or COO
neighbor output is too small.

#### Compiled PyTorch direct APIs

The direct PyTorch cluster-tile functions support
`torch.compile(fullgraph=True)` for tile, matrix, and nonselective exact COO
output. Matrix support includes dual cutoffs. Matrix and exact COO vectors and
distances remain differentiable. Exact COO requires PyTorch 2.10 or newer and
may return a different pair count on each call. Pair callbacks remain
eager-only.

Exact COO is counted and written directly into source-owned CSR rows without a
matrix intermediate. For source atom `i`, entries
`neighbor_ptr[i]:neighbor_ptr[i + 1]` in `neighbor_list` all belong to `i`.
Atomic writes leave pair order within each row unspecified. Shifts and any
requested vectors, distances, energies, or forces use the same pair order.

A compiled single-system call may allocate its scratch internally when
`max_tiles_per_group` is a positive static integer:

```python
import torch

from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import cluster_tile_neighbor_list

@torch.compile(fullgraph=True)
def compiled_matrix(positions, cell):
    return cluster_tile_neighbor_list(
        positions,
        cutoff,
        cell,
        format="matrix",
        max_neighbors=max_neighbors,
        max_tiles_per_group=max_tiles_per_group,
        return_distances=True,
    )
```

For a batched compiled call, allocate once with
`allocate_batch_cluster_tile_list` and pass every tensor in that 19-tensor
scratch tuple through its corresponding keyword argument. Selective matrix
calls additionally require fixed output buffers and tile segment metadata.
Eager calls retain structured `TileBufferOverflow` and
`NeighborOverflowError` exceptions. Compiled capacity failures are asynchronous
device runtime errors.

#### Prepared PyTorch execution

Use `prepare_cluster_tile` when repeated calls have the same atom count,
single or batched partition, dtype, device, output format, and capacities.
Preparation owns the fixed-capacity scratch and output buffers. Execution takes
only the current positions, current cell, and prepared state:

```python
import torch

from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import (
    cluster_tile_neighbor_list_prepared,
    prepare_cluster_tile,
)

state = prepare_cluster_tile(
    positions,
    cutoff,
    cell,
    format="matrix",
    batch_ptr=batch_ptr,  # omit for one system
    max_neighbors=max_neighbors,
    max_tiles_per_group=max_tiles_per_group,
    return_distances=True,
)

@torch.compile(fullgraph=True)
def compiled_neighbors(current_positions, current_cell):
    # Capture state as a closure constant; do not pass it as a graph input.
    return cluster_tile_neighbor_list_prepared(
        current_positions,
        current_cell,
        state,
    )
```

Prepared execution supports single and batched tile, matrix, dual-cutoff
matrix, and nonselective exact COO output. It preserves the corresponding
direct function's return tuple. Matrix and tile results borrow state-owned
storage and a later call overwrites them. Exact COO topology is newly sized on
each call; requested COO vectors and distances remain fixed-capacity borrowed
buffers available as `state.neighbor_vectors` and
`state.neighbor_distances`. Only the active prefix matching the returned pair
count is defined.

Preparation avoids reallocating the fixed scratch and output buffers, but
execution may still allocate temporary tensors and exact-sized COO results. It
is not an allocation-free API. Finish backward, or copy every result that must
survive, before reusing the same state. A second state owns distinct storage.

Preparation fixes the atom count, batch partition, shape, dtype, and device.
Execution rejects mismatches before launching kernels. Prepared pair callbacks,
energies, forces, caller-provided buffers, and selective rebuilds are not
supported.

#### Compiled JAX

JAX fixes array shapes while tracing a transformed or compiled function, and
`max_tiles_per_group` determines the tile-buffer shape. The value must therefore
be a positive static Python integer. Close over it or mark the argument static
with `static_argnames`.

The runtime tile count cannot be converted to a Python value inside the compiled
region, so an undersized bound does not raise `TileBufferOverflow` there. A
compiled workflow can use the lower-level build and query functions and return
the tile counters alongside the neighbor output. After the compiled call:

- For a compact buffer, require
  `int(num_tiles[0]) <= tile_row_group.shape[0]`.
- For segmented buffers, require
  `tile_counts <= tile_offsets[1:] - tile_offsets[:-1]` element by element.

The neighbor output is incomplete when either check fails.

  calls if you have an accurate value to reduce memory requirements as well
  as improve kernel performance. The `estimate_max_neighbors()` method will
  otherwise provide a **very** conservative estimate based on atomic
  density.

`max_tiles_per_group`
: Sets the capacity of the tile-pair buffer shared by all row groups. For $g$
  32-atom groups, a value $m$ reserves $g\,\min(g,m)$ records. The tile-index
  arrays use 8 bytes per record for one system and 12 bytes per record for a
  compact batch. The combined build/query functions estimate the value during
  eager execution when it is `None`. A transformed or compiled JAX call
  requires a positive static Python integer.

`atomic_density`
: Atomic density in atoms per unit volume, used by `estimate_max_neighbors()`.
  Default is 0.2. Increase for dense systems to avoid truncated neighbor lists.

`safety_factor`
: Multiplier applied to the neighbor estimate. Default is 1.0. Provides
  headroom for density fluctuations.

`max_nbins`
: Maximum number of spatial cells for cell list decomposition (the
  `max_total_cells` cap). Defaults to 524288 for single systems and 8192 per system
  for batched inputs. Limits memory usage for very large simulation boxes.

`wrap_positions`
: Controls whether positions are wrapped into the primary cell before neighbor
  search. Default is `True`. Set to `False` when positions are already wrapped
  (e.g. after an integration step that keeps coordinates inside the box) to skip
  two GPU kernel launches per call.
  Only applies to naive methods; cell list methods handle wrapping internally.

`shift_range_per_dimension`, `num_shifts_per_system`, `max_shifts_per_system`
: Optional cached naive-PBC metadata for advanced workflows. Use
  `compute_naive_num_shifts()` to compute these values outside repeated calls,
  especially for JAX where `max_shifts_per_system` must be concrete outside
  `jax.jit`. Older `shift_offset` and `total_shifts` inputs are no longer part
  of the public Torch/JAX API.

### Estimation Utilities

The {func}`~nvalchemiops.neighbors.neighbor_utils.estimate_max_neighbors` function estimates
the maximum number of neighbors $n$ any atom could have based on the cutoff sphere
volume ($r$) and atomic density $\rho$, with an additional safety factor ($S$):

$$
n = S \times \rho \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
$$

```{note}
The JAX `estimate_cell_list_sizes` takes `positions` as its first argument
(to infer array sizes) and uses a `buffer_factor` parameter instead of
`max_nbins`. It also returns a 3-tuple.
This function is **not** compatible with `jax.jit` because it derives
concrete array sizes from traced data.
```

:::

::::

**Setting `atomic_density`**: This should reflect the expected atomic density of
your system in atoms per unit volume (using the same length units as `cutoff`).
If set too low, the neighbor matrix may be too narrow and a
`NeighborOverflowError` will be raised at runtime. If set too high, memory is
wasted on unused columns.

**Setting `safety_factor`**: This multiplier provides headroom for local density
fluctuations (e.g., atoms clustering in one region). The default of 1.0 is
typically sufficient for systems with reasonably uniform density (e.g. standard
public datasets). Increase it for systems with significant density variation
where atoms may cluster in one region.

```{tip}
Users should check the "convergence" of the neighbor list computation by checking
the respective array containing the number of neighbors per atom, against
the maximum estimated number of neighbors. For optimal performance these
two factors should be close: if the actual number of neighbors per atom is
low relative to the estimated number, the allocated neighbor matrix will
be very sparse and memory inefficient (i.e. most elements will be padding).
If the actual number exceeds the estimate, neighborhoods will be truncated
and there is no guarantee that the nearest neighbors are included.
```

### Pre-allocation for Repeated Calculations

Pre-allocating output arrays avoids repeated memory allocation overhead when
computing neighbor lists repeatedly across calls.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} PyTorch
:sync: pytorch

Pre-allocation also enables `torch.compile` compatibility by ensuring fixed
tensor shapes.

```python
import torch
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list
from nvalchemiops.neighbors.neighbor_utils import estimate_max_neighbors

num_atoms = positions.shape[0]
max_neighbors = estimate_max_neighbors(cutoff, atomic_density=0.15)

# Pre-allocate tensors
neighbor_matrix = torch.full(
    (num_atoms, max_neighbors), num_atoms, dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda"
)
neighbor_matrix_shifts = torch.zeros(
    (num_atoms, max_neighbors, 3), dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda"
)
num_neighbors = torch.zeros(num_atoms, dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda")

# Pass pre-allocated tensors
neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc,
    neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix,
    neighbor_matrix_shifts=neighbor_matrix_shifts,
    num_neighbors=num_neighbors,
    fill_value=num_atoms
)
```

For cell list methods, you can also pre-allocate the spatial data structures:

```python
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors.cell_list import estimate_cell_list_sizes
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors.neighbor_utils import allocate_cell_list

max_total_cells, neighbor_search_radius = estimate_cell_list_sizes(cell, pbc, cutoff)

(
    cells_per_dimension, neighbor_search_radius,
    atom_periodic_shifts, atom_to_cell_mapping,
    atoms_per_cell_count, cell_atom_start_indices, cell_atom_list
) = allocate_cell_list(num_atoms, max_total_cells, neighbor_search_radius, device)

neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc,
    cells_per_dimension=cells_per_dimension,
    neighbor_search_radius=neighbor_search_radius,
    atom_periodic_shifts=atom_periodic_shifts,
    atom_to_cell_mapping=atom_to_cell_mapping,
    atoms_per_cell_count=atoms_per_cell_count,
    cell_atom_start_indices=cell_atom_start_indices,
    cell_atom_list=cell_atom_list
)
```

:::

:::{tab-item} JAX
:sync: jax

JAX returns new arrays rather than mutating inputs in place. For fixed
`jax.jit` layouts, pass size controls such as `max_neighbors` and
`max_total_cells` as static ints; on APIs that accept caller-owned arrays, pass
pre-shaped arrays to define the returned buffer layout and allow XLA donation or
reuse. With `target_indices`, those arrays must have compact `num_targets` rows.

```python
from nvalchemiops.jax.neighbors import neighbor_list
from nvalchemiops.neighbors.neighbor_utils import estimate_max_neighbors

num_atoms = positions.shape[0]
max_neighbors = estimate_max_neighbors(cutoff, atomic_density=0.15)

# Pass max_neighbors (a static int) to fix the output width for jax.jit.
neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff,
    cell=cell,
    pbc=pbc,
    max_neighbors=max_neighbors,
    fill_value=num_atoms,
)
```

For cell-list methods, also pass `max_total_cells` so the cell grid is statically
sized (derive it with `estimate_cell_list_sizes`):

```python
from nvalchemiops.jax.neighbors import estimate_cell_list_sizes, neighbor_list
from nvalchemiops.neighbors.neighbor_utils import estimate_max_neighbors

max_total_cells, _radius, _ = estimate_cell_list_sizes(
    positions, cell, cutoff, pbc=pbc
)
max_neighbors = estimate_max_neighbors(cutoff)

neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff,
    cell=cell,
    pbc=pbc,
    method="cell_list",
    max_neighbors=max_neighbors,
    max_total_cells=max_total_cells,
)
```

:::

::::

```{warning}
If `max_neighbors` is too small, neighbors beyond that limit are silently
dropped. Monitor `num_neighbors.max()` (PyTorch) or `jnp.max(num_neighbors)`
(JAX) against your `max_neighbors` setting to detect truncation.
```

CUDA-only and opt-in; JAX `naive` auto-selection still uses the scalar kernel.

### Selective Rebuild (`rebuild_flags`)

In batched workflows, `rebuild_flags` re-enumerates only the systems that need a
fresh list and **preserves the previous output for the rest** — the skip happens on
the GPU with no host sync. Combine it with rebuild detection
(`batch_neighbor_list_needs_rebuild` / `batch_cell_list_needs_rebuild`) so only the
systems whose atoms crossed the skin distance are recomputed:

```python
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors.rebuild_detection import (
    batch_cell_list_needs_rebuild,
)

rebuild_flags = batch_cell_list_needs_rebuild(...)  # (num_systems,) bool

# Reuse the previous step's output buffers; only flagged systems are rewritten.
neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell=cells, pbc=pbc, batch_idx=batch_idx,
    rebuild_flags=rebuild_flags,
    neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix,
    num_neighbors=num_neighbors,
    neighbor_matrix_shifts=shifts,
)
```

Systems with `rebuild_flags[i] == False` keep their existing rows from the passed-in
buffers, so reuse the previous step's output arrays. Supported for matrix and
segmented-COO outputs in both the PyTorch and JAX `batch_naive` / `batch_cell_list`
paths (single-system paths take a whole-system flag of shape `(1,)`). It is not
combined with differentiable per-pair geometry.

Cluster-tile selective rebuilds also require the tile-list buffers. JAX returns that
state as part of every selective result. Zero-atom calls keep the same arity as
nonempty calls: selective matrix output contains the matrix triple plus tile state
(and both matrix triples for dual cutoff), while segmented COO remains the normal
seven-array single-system or ten-array batched tuple.

PyTorch keeps the existing return arity by default. To receive the tile state, select
the cluster-tile method explicitly and pass `return_state=True` with
`rebuild_flags`:

- Single-system matrix output appends `(num_tiles, tile_row_group,
  tile_col_group)`, yielding six tensors for one cutoff and nine for two.
- Single-system segmented COO returns `(neighbor_list, pair_offsets,
  pair_counts, neighbor_list_shifts)` and appends `(num_tiles,
  tile_row_group, tile_col_group)` with `return_state=True`, yielding seven
  tensors. The fixed buffers have shapes `(2, max_pairs)`, `(2,)`, `(1,)`, and
  `(max_pairs, 3)`; `pair_offsets` is `[0, max_pairs]`, and
  `pair_counts[0]` gives the active prefix. Values after that prefix are
  inactive.
- Batched matrix output appends `(tile_offsets, tile_counts, num_tiles,
  tile_row_group, tile_col_group, tile_system)`, yielding nine tensors for one
  cutoff and twelve for two.
- Batched segmented COO appends the same six state tensors to its four topology
  outputs, yielding ten tensors.

    tile_system,
) = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff,
    cell=cells,
    pbc=pbc,
    batch_ptr=batch_ptr,
    method="batch_cluster_tile",
    rebuild_flags=rebuild_flags,
    return_state=True,
)
```

For a single-system fixed-capacity COO workflow, retain the public topology
buffers and tile state from the previous step:

```python
(
    neighbor_list_coo,
    pair_offsets,
    pair_counts,
    shifts_coo,
    num_tiles,
    tile_row_group,
    tile_col_group,
) = neighbor_list(
    positions,
    cutoff,
    cell=cell,
    pbc=pbc,
    method="cluster_tile",
    return_neighbor_list=True,
    rebuild_flags=rebuild_flags,  # shape (1,)
    neighbor_list=neighbor_list_coo,
    pair_offsets=pair_offsets,  # tensor([0, max_pairs], dtype=torch.int32)
    pair_counts=pair_counts,
    neighbor_list_shifts=shifts_coo,
    num_tiles=num_tiles,
    tile_row_group=tile_row_group,
    tile_col_group=tile_col_group,
    return_state=True,
)
```

Pass the returned topology buffers and state back on the next call. `return_state`
is intentionally rejected for auto-selected and non-cluster-tile methods, and it
requires `rebuild_flags`. Caller-supplied state tensors are returned by identity:
the suffix aliases the same buffers, which the next selective call updates in place.
When only the public state suffix is supplied, temporary sorting scratch is allocated
internally without replacing those state buffers.

Use two phases for PyTorch selective COO. First make an eager bootstrap call with
every flag true; it may allocate omitted topology and tile buffers and returns the
reusable state. Every later eager call containing a false flag must supply all fixed
topology and tile-state buffers, otherwise it raises `ValueError` before a kernel
launch. Single-system Torch and JAX COO state has one segment:
`pair_offsets` must stay `[0, physical_capacity]`, and `pair_counts` has one value.

```python
# Eager bootstrap: omit every persistent buffer.
state = cluster_tile_neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell, format="coo", return_state=True,
    rebuild_flags=torch.ones(1, dtype=torch.bool, device=positions.device),
)
```

The direct single-system `cluster_tile_neighbor_list` route also supports
`torch.compile(fullgraph=True)` for this steady-state phase. Bootstrap and validate
capacities eagerly, then compile a function that accepts fixed-shape buffers and
`rebuild_flags`; compiled calls preserve false-flag data and rebuild true-flag data.
False flags retain the fixed launch graph, so they do not promise zero preprocessing
or kernel launches. The unified `neighbor_list(..., method="cluster_tile")` dispatch
is unsupported under compilation because it cannot validate tensor-valued `pbc`
without host synchronization. Compiled calls also omit
host-synchronized offset and overflow diagnostics, so retain the eagerly validated
capacities. The Warp COO query enforces physical output-buffer bounds as defense in
depth, but mutated or malformed metadata remains unsupported. Compiled Torch and
JIT-compiled JAX cannot synchronize to raise a data-dependent metadata error. If
caller-provided single-system offsets no longer equal `[0, physical_capacity]`, a
true rebuild is suppressed before it writes and the returned active count is zero.
For valid offsets, an overflowed count is capped at writable capacity. A false
rebuild retains valid prior buffers and counts; malformed metadata still returns a
zero active count without changing those buffers. This prevents a returned count
from naming unwritten entries; it does not make mutated metadata supported. Batched
cluster-tile fullgraph support is not provided.

```python
@torch.compile(fullgraph=True)
def reuse(flags, neighbor_list, pair_offsets, pair_counts, shifts, num_tiles, row, col):
    return cluster_tile_neighbor_list(
        positions, cutoff, cell, format="coo", return_state=True,
        rebuild_flags=flags, neighbor_list=neighbor_list, pair_offsets=pair_offsets,
        pair_counts=pair_counts, neighbor_list_shifts=shifts, num_tiles=num_tiles,
        tile_row_group=row, tile_col_group=col,
    )
```

### Dual Cutoff

Compute two neighbor lists with different cutoffs simultaneously:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} PyTorch
:sync: pytorch

```python
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list

cutoff1, cutoff2 = 3.0, 6.0

(
    neighbor_matrix1, num_neighbors1, shifts1,
    neighbor_matrix2, num_neighbors2, shifts2
) = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff1, cutoff2=cutoff2, cell=cell, pbc=pbc
)

# neighbor_matrix1: neighbors within cutoff1
# neighbor_matrix2: neighbors within cutoff2 (superset of cutoff1)
```

:::

:::{tab-item} JAX
:sync: jax

```python
from nvalchemiops.jax.neighbors import neighbor_list

cutoff1, cutoff2 = 3.0, 6.0

(
    neighbor_matrix1, num_neighbors1, shifts1,
    neighbor_matrix2, num_neighbors2, shifts2
) = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff1, cutoff2=cutoff2, cell=cell, pbc=pbc
)

# neighbor_matrix1: neighbors within cutoff1
# neighbor_matrix2: neighbors within cutoff2 (superset of cutoff1)
```

:::

### Partial Neighbor Lists (`target_indices`)

Pass `target_indices` (an `int32` array of atom indices) to build neighbors only for a
subset of *central* atoms. Output rows are **compact**: there are `num_targets` rows
and row `r` corresponds to atom `target_indices[r]`. In COO output the source index
`nl[0]` is the compact row in `[0, num_targets)` (map it back through `target_indices`):

```python
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list

target_indices = torch.tensor([0, 5, 9], dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda")
nm, num_neighbors, shifts = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc, target_indices=target_indices,
)
# nm has 3 rows; row r holds the neighbors of atom target_indices[r].
```

Supported on the `naive` / `cell_list` paths and their batched forms across Warp,
PyTorch, and JAX, including low-level JAX cell-list query wrappers; `cluster_tile`
does not support `target_indices`. On JAX, `cell_list` `target_indices` runs through
the `atom_centric` strategy (`pair_centric` plus `target_indices` is rejected;
identical results are available via `atom_centric`).

### Per-Pair Distances and Vectors

Pass `return_distances=True` and/or `return_vectors=True` to get the per-pair
separation distances `|r_ij|` and displacement vectors `r_ij` alongside the neighbor
matrix, avoiding a manual recompute downstream. Each flag appends one array to the
return tuple, in the order *distances, then vectors*:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} PyTorch
:sync: pytorch

```python
from nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors import neighbor_list

nm, num_neighbors, shifts, distances, vectors = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc,
    return_distances=True, return_vectors=True,
)
# distances: (n_atoms, max_neighbors)      |r_ij| per slot
# vectors:   (n_atoms, max_neighbors, 3)   r_ij per slot
```

:::

:::{tab-item} JAX
:sync: jax

```python
from nvalchemiops.jax.neighbors import neighbor_list

nm, num_neighbors, shifts, distances, vectors = neighbor_list(
    positions, cutoff, cell=cell, pbc=pbc,
    return_distances=True, return_vectors=True,
)
```

:::

::::

The default matrix format returns `distances` with shape `(n_atoms, max_neighbors)`
and `vectors` with shape `(n_atoms, max_neighbors, 3)`, slot-aligned with
`neighbor_matrix`. With the COO format (`return_neighbor_list=True`) the `naive` and
`cell_list` paths repack them into flat per-pair arrays `(num_pairs,)` and
`(num_pairs, 3)` that index-align with the returned neighbor list. The returned
`distances` / `vectors` are differentiable with respect to `positions` (and `cell`)
on both the PyTorch and JAX paths (each emitted pair's geometry is reconstructed
live from its indices and shift), so they can flow straight into a loss without
re-deriving geometry.

### Inline Pair Potentials with `pair_fn`

Supply a Warp `pair_fn` to evaluate a pairwise potential *as neighbors are enumerated*,
filling `pair_energies` / `pair_forces` in the same pass — no second loop over the
neighbor list. `pair_fn` is a `wp.Function` taking the separation vector, distance, a
per-atom `pair_params` table, and the pair indices, and returning `(energy, force)`:

```python
import warp as wp

@wp.func
def lj_pair_fn(
    r_ij: wp.vec3f,
    distance: wp.float32,
    pair_params: wp.array2d(dtype=wp.float32),
    i: int,
    j: int,
):
    epsilon = wp.sqrt(pair_params[i, 0] * pair_params[j, 0])
    sigma = 0.5 * (pair_params[i, 1] + pair_params[j, 1])
    sr = sigma / distance
    sr2 = sr * sr
    sr6 = sr2 * sr2 * sr2
    sr12 = sr6 * sr6
    energy = 4.0 * epsilon * (sr12 - sr6)
    force = (24.0 * epsilon * (sr6 - 2.0 * sr12) / (distance * distance)) * r_ij
    return energy, force
```

Pass `pair_fn` with its per-atom `pair_params` table. The `pair_energies` /
`pair_forces` outputs are **optional**: like `neighbor_matrix`, they are allocated for
you when omitted and appended to the return tuple — matrix-shaped in matrix output, or
flat COO `(num_pairs,)` / `(num_pairs, 3)` aligned with the neighbor list when
`return_neighbor_list=True`. (If you do pass buffers, they are also filled in place.)
See `examples/neighbors/06_pair_outputs_lj.py` for a complete, validated
Lennard-Jones example, including combination with `target_indices`.

```{note}
`pair_fn` is supported on the **Warp, PyTorch, and JAX** paths — `naive`, `cell_list`,
`cluster_tile`, and their batched forms.  The JAX bindings build a per-`pair_fn`
callable at call time that closes over the `wp.Function` (cached by `pair_fn`
identity): a `jax_kernel` over the specialized naive / cell-list kernel, and a
`jax_callable` over the Warp `query_cluster_tile` launcher for the tile paths.
cluster-tile pair outputs are fp32-only and support both matrix and COO output
(COO packs the matrix result and is eager-only — its pair count is data-dependent,
so a traced call raises; use `format="matrix"` under `jax.jit`).  `pair_energies` /
`pair_forces` are **forward-only**
outputs (the Warp kernels are registered with `enable_backward=False`); use
`return_distances` / `return_vectors` for differentiable geometry. Differentiating a
loss through `pair_energies` / `pair_forces` returns a **zero** gradient under JAX
(they are `stop_gradient`'d). Under JAX the energy/force buffers are always
auto-allocated and returned (functional arrays cannot be filled in place), and — like
the differentiable-geometry path — a traced (jit'd) cutoff is not yet supported.

On JAX, `naive` / `batch_naive` and `cell_list` / `batch_cell_list` support
`target_indices` (partial neighbor lists) combined with pair outputs: the
compact output has `num_targets` rows (row `r` → atom `target_indices[r]`), and
in COO mode the source index `nl[0]` is the compact row in `[0, num_targets)`
(mapped back via `target_indices`), matching the Torch contract.

For PyTorch `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`, pass a pre-specialized wrapper from
`nvalchemiops.torch.neighbors.compile_pair_fn(pair_fn)` instead of the raw
`wp.Function`. The compiled wrapper registers fixed-shape matrix custom ops for
Torch `naive`, `batch_naive`, `cell_list`, and `batch_cell_list`, including
compact `target_indices` rows on the naive paths. Raw `wp.Function` pair outputs
remain eager-only under fullgraph, and COO pair-output packing remains outside
the compiled matrix path.
```

This concludes the high-level documentation for neighbor lists: you should now
be able to integrate `nvalchemiops` routines for your neighbor list requirements,
and consult the API reference for [PyTorch](../../modules/torch/neighbors)
, [JAX](../../modules/jax/neighbors), and [Warp](../../modules/warp/neighbors) for further details.
