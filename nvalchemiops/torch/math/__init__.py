PyTorch bindings and host-side scaffolding for the ``nvalchemiops.math`` layer.

The Warp kernels and ``@wp.func`` primitives live in :mod:`nvalchemiops.math`;
this package provides:

* Host-side precompute helpers that evaluate into Warp-ready constant tables
  (e.g. GTO basis normalization, GTO-GTO self-overlap integrals).
* Thin PyTorch launch wrappers used by tests and downstream bindings. These
  wrappers stay minimal on purpose — ``torch.compile`` / autograd-aware
  wrappers are only added when a specific pipeline needs them, following the
  ``nvalchemiops.warp_dispatch`` pattern used by
  :mod:`nvalchemiops.torch.interactions.electrostatics`.
