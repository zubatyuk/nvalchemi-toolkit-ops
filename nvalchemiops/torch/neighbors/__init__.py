    """Compute neighbor list using the appropriate method based on the provided parameters.

    This is the main entry point for PyTorch users of the neighbor list API. It automatically
    selects the most appropriate algorithm (naive :math:`O(N^2)` or cell list :math:`O(N)`) based on system
    size and parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : torch.Tensor, shape (total_atoms, 3)
        Concatenated atomic coordinates for all systems in Cartesian space.
        Each row represents one atom's (x, y, z) position.
        Unwrapped (box-crossing) coordinates are supported when PBC is used;
        the kernel wraps positions internally.
    cutoff : float
        Cutoff distance for neighbor detection in Cartesian units.
        Must be positive. Atoms within this distance are considered neighbors.
    cell : torch.Tensor, shape (3, 3) or (num_systems, 3, 3), optional
        Cell matrix defining the simulation box.
    pbc : torch.Tensor, shape (3,) or (num_systems, 3), dtype=torch.bool, optional
        Periodic boundary condition flags for each dimension.
    batch_idx : torch.Tensor, shape (total_atoms,), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        System index for each atom.  Must be **sorted by system** (i.e.,
        atoms in system 0 first, then system 1, and so on).  Interleaved
        layouts are not supported by ``cluster_tile`` / ``batch_cluster_tile``
        and will silently emit cross-system pairs.  For ``cell_list`` /
        ``naive`` methods, interleaved layouts work but ``batch_ptr``
        will still be derived assuming a contiguous layout.
    batch_ptr : torch.Tensor, shape (num_systems + 1,), dtype=torch.int32, optional
        Cumulative atom counts defining system boundaries.
    cutoff2 : float, optional
        Second cutoff distance for neighbor detection in Cartesian units.
        Must be positive. Atoms within this distance are considered neighbors.
    half_fill : bool, optional
        If True, only store half of the neighbor relationships to avoid double counting.
        Another half could be reconstructed by swapping source and target indices and inverting unit shifts.
    fill_value : int | None, optional
        Value to fill the neighbor matrix with. Default is total_atoms.
    return_neighbor_list : bool, optional - default = False
        If True, convert the neighbor matrix to a neighbor list (idx_i, idx_j) format by
        creating a mask over the fill_value, which can incur a performance penalty.
        We recommend using the neighbor matrix format,
        and only convert to a neighbor list format if absolutely necessary.
    method : str | None, optional
        Method to use for neighbor list computation.
        Choices: "naive", "cell_list", "cluster_tile", "batch_naive",
        "batch_cell_list", "batch_cluster_tile", "naive_dual_cutoff",
        "batch_naive_dual_cutoff". If None, a default method is chosen by
        comparing estimated work from per-system atom counts and cell (or
        bounding-box) volumes and can select cluster-tile when the CUDA,
        float32, fully-periodic, contiguous-batch, and output-option guards
        allow it. Method names that do not start with ``batch_`` refer to
        single-system algorithms. When ``batch_idx`` or ``batch_ptr`` (batch
        metadata) is supplied, those explicit method names are treated as aliases
        for the corresponding ``batch_*`` methods. For example,
        ``method="naive"`` is dispatched as ``method="batch_naive"`` when batch
        metadata is provided. When only ``batch_idx`` is provided (no
        ``batch_ptr`` or 3-D ``cell``),
        auto-selection computes ``batch_idx.max() + 1`` (and a ``bincount``)
        which triggers a device-to-host
        synchronization. To avoid this, pass ``batch_ptr``, a 3-D ``cell``
        array, or specify ``method`` explicitly.
    wrap_positions : bool, default=True
        If True, wrap input positions into the primary cell before
        neighbor search. Set to False when positions are already
        wrapped (e.g. by a preceding integration step) to save two
        GPU kernel launches per call. Only applies to naive methods; cell list
        methods handle wrapping internally.
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the method.

        max_neighbors : int, optional
            Maximum number of neighbors per atom.
            Can be provided to aid in allocation for both naive and cell list methods.
        max_neighbors2 : int, optional
            Maximum number of neighbors per atom within cutoff2.
            Can be provided to aid in allocation for naive dual cutoff method.
        max_tiles_per_group : int, optional
            Capacity factor for the intermediate tile-pair buffer used by
            cluster-tile methods. For ``g`` row groups, the buffer holds
            ``g * min(g, max_tiles_per_group)`` tile pairs. Increasing the value
            up to ``g`` uses more memory and accommodates more candidate tile
            pairs. Eager calls estimate the value when it is ``None``. See
            :ref:`cluster-tile-buffer-capacity` for sizing details.
        neighbor_matrix : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (num_rows, max_neighbors) for neighbor indices,
            where ``num_rows`` is ``total_atoms`` normally and
            ``len(target_indices)`` for partial lists.
            Can be provided to avoid reallocation for both naive and cell list methods.
        neighbor_matrix_shifts : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (num_rows, max_neighbors, 3) for shift vectors.
            Can be provided to avoid reallocation for both naive and cell list methods.
        num_neighbors : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (num_rows,) for neighbor counts.
            Can be provided to avoid reallocation for both naive and cell list methods.
        shift_range_per_dimension : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (1, 3) for shift range in each dimension.
            Can be provided to avoid reallocation for naive methods.
        num_shifts_per_system : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-computed tensor of shape (num_systems,) for the number of periodic
            shifts per system. Can be provided to avoid recomputation for naive methods.
        max_shifts_per_system : int, optional
            Maximum per-system shift count.
            Can be provided to avoid recomputation for naive methods.
        cells_per_dimension : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (3,) for number of cells in x, y, z directions.
            Can be provided to avoid reallocation for cell list construction.
        neighbor_search_radius : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (3,) for radius of neighboring cells to search
            in each dimension. Can be provided to avoid reallocation for cell list construction.
        atom_periodic_shifts : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (total_atoms, 3) for periodic boundary crossings
            for each atom. Can be provided to avoid reallocation for cell list construction.
        atom_to_cell_mapping : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (total_atoms, 3) for cell coordinates for each atom.
            Can be provided to avoid reallocation for cell list construction.
        atoms_per_cell_count : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (max_total_cells,) for number of atoms in each cell.
            Can be provided to avoid reallocation for cell list construction.
        cell_atom_start_indices : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (max_total_cells,) for starting index in
            cell_atom_list for each cell. Can be provided to avoid reallocation for
            cell list construction.
        cell_atom_list : torch.Tensor, optional
            Pre-allocated tensor of shape (total_atoms,) for flattened list of atom
            indices organized by cell. Can be provided to avoid reallocation for
            cell list construction.
        max_atoms_per_system : int, optional
            Maximum number of atoms per system. Used in batch naive implementation
            with PBC. If not provided, it will be computed automatically.
            Can be provided to avoid CUDA synchronization.
        target_indices : torch.Tensor, optional
            Restrict the source rows of the neighbor list to this subset of atom
            indices (partial neighbor list). Matrix outputs use
            ``len(target_indices)`` compact rows; COO source rows are compact row
            ids. Supported by naive and cell-list methods; not by cluster_tile.
        return_distances : bool, default=False
            Also return per-pair distances ``|r_ij|`` in matrix layout
            ``(num_rows, max_neighbors)``, where ``num_rows`` is
            ``total_atoms`` normally and ``len(target_indices)`` for partial
            lists, differentiable w.r.t. positions (and cell). See the user
            guide for layout notes.
        return_vectors : bool, default=False
            Also return per-pair displacement vectors ``r_ij`` in matrix layout
            ``(num_rows, max_neighbors, 3)``, differentiable w.r.t. positions
            (and cell).
        rebuild_flags : torch.Tensor, optional
            Boolean flags selecting which systems to re-enumerate; systems whose
            flag is ``False`` keep their previous output (per-system skip for the
            batched methods, whole-list flag for single-system methods).
        pair_offsets, pair_counts : torch.Tensor, optional
            Fixed segmented COO metadata for explicit
            ``method="cluster_tile"`` with ``return_neighbor_list=True`` and
            ``rebuild_flags``. Single-system tensors have shapes ``(2,)`` and
            ``(1,)`` int32 and are returned with the fixed-capacity COO buffers.
        return_state : bool, default=False
            With ``rebuild_flags`` and an explicit ``method="cluster_tile"`` or
            ``method="batch_cluster_tile"``, append reusable tile state to the
            result. See the selected method's return contract for exact tensors.
        pair_fn : warp.Function or CompiledPairFn, optional
            Inline Warp pair potential evaluated as neighbors are enumerated;
            requires ``pair_params`` and fills ``pair_energies`` / ``pair_forces``.
            Forward-only (not differentiable). Pass ``compile_pair_fn(pair_fn)``
            before ``torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`` to use fixed-shape matrix
            outputs in compiled regions. See ``examples/neighbors/06_pair_outputs_lj.py``.
        pair_params, pair_energies, pair_forces : torch.Tensor, optional
            Per-atom parameter table and per-pair energy / force output buffers
            consumed and filled by ``pair_fn``.

    Returns
    -------
    results : tuple of torch.Tensor
        Variable-length tuple depending on input parameters. The return pattern follows:

        **Single cutoff:**
          - No PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors)``
          - No PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr)``
          - With PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, neighbor_matrix_shifts)``
          - With PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr, neighbor_list_shifts)``

        **Dual cutoff:**
          - No PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix1, num_neighbors1, neighbor_matrix2, num_neighbors2)``
          - No PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list1, neighbor_ptr1, neighbor_list2, neighbor_ptr2)``
          - With PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix1, num_neighbors1, neighbor_matrix_shifts1, neighbor_matrix2, num_neighbors2, neighbor_matrix_shifts2)``
          - With PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list1, neighbor_ptr1, neighbor_list_shifts1, neighbor_list2, neighbor_ptr2, neighbor_list_shifts2)``

        **Components returned:**

        - **neighbor_data** (tensor): Neighbor indices, format depends on ``return_neighbor_list``:

            - If ``return_neighbor_list=False`` (default): Returns ``neighbor_matrix``
              with shape (num_rows, max_neighbors), dtype int32, where
              ``num_rows`` is ``total_atoms`` normally and ``len(target_indices)``
              for partial lists. Row ``r`` contains neighbors for atom ``r`` or
              ``target_indices[r]`` respectively.
            - If ``return_neighbor_list=True``: Returns ``neighbor_list`` with shape
              (2, num_pairs), dtype int32, in COO format [source_rows, target_atoms].
              With ``target_indices``, source rows are compact row ids.

        - **num_neighbor_data** (tensor): Information about the number of neighbors for each atom,
          format depends on ``return_neighbor_list``:

            - If ``return_neighbor_list=False`` (default): Returns ``num_neighbors`` with shape (num_rows,), dtype int32.
              Count of neighbors found for each atom.
            - If ``return_neighbor_list=True``: Returns ``neighbor_ptr`` with shape (num_rows + 1,), dtype int32.
              CSR-style pointer arrays where ``neighbor_ptr_data[i]`` to ``neighbor_ptr_data[i+1]`` gives the range of
              neighbors for row i in the flattened neighbor list.

        - **neighbor_shift_data** (tensor, optional): Periodic shift vectors, only when ``pbc`` is provided:
          format depends on ``return_neighbor_list``:

            - If ``return_neighbor_list=False`` (default): Returns ``neighbor_matrix_shifts`` with
              shape (num_rows, max_neighbors, 3), dtype int32.
            - If ``return_neighbor_list=True``: Returns ``unit_shifts`` with shape
              (num_pairs, 3), dtype int32.

        When ``cutoff2`` is provided, the pattern repeats for the second cutoff with interleaved
        components (neighbor_data2, num_neighbor_data2, neighbor_shift_data2) appended to the tuple.
        Explicit cluster-tile methods append their documented tile-state suffix
        when ``return_state=True``.

        Single-system selective COO calls to explicit ``method="cluster_tile"``
        return ``(neighbor_list, pair_offsets, pair_counts,
        neighbor_list_shifts)`` instead of the compact COO pointer tuple. With
        ``return_state=True``, ``(num_tiles, tile_row_group, tile_col_group)``
        is appended.

        Batched selective calls to explicit ``method="batch_cluster_tile"`` append
        ``(tile_offsets, tile_counts, num_tiles, tile_row_group, tile_col_group,
        tile_system)`` when ``return_state=True``. The resulting matrix tuple has
        nine tensors (or twelve with ``cutoff2``); segmented COO returns
        ``(neighbor_list, pair_offsets, pair_counts, neighbor_list_shifts,
        tile_offsets, tile_counts, num_tiles, tile_row_group, tile_col_group,
        tile_system)``.

    Examples
    --------
    Single cutoff, matrix format, with PBC::

        >>> nm, num, shifts = neighbor_list(pos, 5.0, cell=cell, pbc=pbc)

    Single cutoff, list format, no PBC::

        >>> nlist, ptr = neighbor_list(pos, 5.0, return_neighbor_list=True)

    Dual cutoff, matrix format, with PBC::

        >>> nm1, num1, sh1, nm2, num2, sh2 = neighbor_list(
        ...     pos, 2.5, cutoff2=5.0, cell=cell, pbc=pbc
