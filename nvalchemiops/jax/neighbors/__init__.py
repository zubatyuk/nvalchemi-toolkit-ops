    """Compute neighbor list using the appropriate method based on the provided parameters.

    This is the main entry point for JAX users of the neighbor list API. It automatically
    selects the most appropriate algorithm (naive :math:`O(N^2)` or cell list :math:`O(N)`) based on system
    size and parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : jax.Array, shape (total_atoms, 3)
        Concatenated atomic coordinates for all systems in Cartesian space.
        Each row represents one atom's (x, y, z) position.
        Unwrapped (box-crossing) coordinates are supported when PBC is used;
        the kernel wraps positions internally.
    cutoff : float
        Cutoff distance for neighbor detection in Cartesian units.
        Must be positive. Atoms within this distance are considered neighbors.
    cell : jax.Array, shape (3, 3) or (num_systems, 3, 3), optional
        Cell matrix defining the simulation box.
    pbc : jax.Array, shape (3,) or (num_systems, 3), dtype=bool, optional
        Periodic boundary condition flags for each dimension.
    batch_idx : jax.Array, shape (total_atoms,), dtype=jnp.int32, optional
        System index for each atom.
    batch_ptr : jax.Array, shape (num_systems + 1,), dtype=jnp.int32, optional
        Cumulative atom counts defining system boundaries.
    cutoff2 : float, optional
        Second cutoff distance for neighbor detection in Cartesian units.
        Must be positive. Atoms within this distance are considered neighbors.
    half_fill : bool, optional
        If True, only store half of the neighbor relationships to avoid double counting.
        Another half could be reconstructed by swapping source and target indices and inverting unit shifts.
    fill_value : int | None, optional
        Value to fill the neighbor matrix with. Default is total_atoms.
    return_neighbor_list : bool, optional - default = False
        If True, convert the neighbor matrix to a neighbor list (idx_i, idx_j) format by
        creating a mask over the fill_value, which can incur a performance penalty.
        We recommend using the neighbor matrix format,
        and only convert to a neighbor list format if absolutely necessary.

    method : str | None, optional
        Method to use for neighbor list computation.
        Choices: "naive", "cell_list", "cluster_tile", "batch_naive",
        "batch_cell_list", "batch_cluster_tile", "naive_dual_cutoff",
        "batch_naive_dual_cutoff". If None, a default method is chosen by
        comparing estimated work from per-system atom counts and cell (or
        bounding-box) volumes and can select cluster-tile when the CUDA,
        float32, fully-periodic, contiguous-batch, and output-option guards
        allow it. Method names that do not start with ``batch_`` refer to
        single-system algorithms. When ``batch_idx`` or ``batch_ptr`` (batch
        metadata) is supplied, those explicit method names are treated as aliases
        for the corresponding ``batch_*`` methods. For example,
        ``method="naive"`` is dispatched as ``method="batch_naive"`` when batch
        metadata is provided. When only ``batch_idx`` is provided (no
        ``batch_ptr`` or 3-D ``cell``),
        auto-selection computes ``batch_idx.max() + 1`` (and a ``bincount``)
        which triggers a device-to-host
        synchronization. To avoid this, pass ``batch_ptr``, a 3-D ``cell``
        array, or specify ``method`` explicitly.
    wrap_positions : bool, default=True
        If True, wrap input positions into the primary cell before
        neighbor search. Set to False when positions are already
        wrapped (e.g. by a preceding integration step) to save two
        GPU kernel launches per call. Only applies to naive methods; cell list
        methods handle wrapping internally.
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the method.

        max_neighbors : int, optional
            Maximum number of neighbors per atom.
            Can be provided to aid in allocation for both naive and cell list methods.
        max_neighbors2 : int, optional
            Maximum number of neighbors per atom within cutoff2.
            Can be provided to aid in allocation for naive dual cutoff method.
        max_tiles_per_group : int, optional
            Capacity factor for the intermediate tile-pair buffer used by
            cluster-tile methods. For ``g`` row groups, the buffer holds
            ``g * min(g, max_tiles_per_group)`` tile pairs. Increasing the value
            up to ``g`` uses more memory and accommodates more candidate tile
            pairs. Eager calls estimate the value when it is ``None``.
            Transformed or compiled calls require a positive static Python
            integer. See :ref:`cluster-tile-buffer-capacity` for sizing details.
        neighbor_matrix : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (num_rows, max_neighbors) for neighbor indices,
            where ``num_rows`` is ``total_atoms`` normally and
            ``len(target_indices)`` for partial lists.
            Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for both naive and cell list methods.
        neighbor_matrix_shifts : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (num_rows, max_neighbors, 3) for shift vectors.
            Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for both naive and cell list methods.
        num_neighbors : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (num_rows,) for neighbor counts.
            Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for both naive and cell list methods.
        shift_range_per_dimension : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-computed array of shape (1, 3) for shift range in each dimension.
            Can be provided to avoid recomputation for naive methods.
        num_shifts_per_system : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-computed array of shape (num_systems,) for the number of periodic
            shifts per system. Can be provided to avoid recomputation for naive methods.
        max_shifts_per_system : int, optional
            Maximum per-system shift count.
            Can be provided to avoid recomputation for naive methods.
        cells_per_dimension : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-computed array of shape (3,) for number of cells in x, y, z directions.
            Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for cell list construction.
        neighbor_search_radius : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-computed array of shape (3,) for radius of neighboring cells to search
            in each dimension. Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for cell list construction.
        atom_periodic_shifts : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (total_atoms, 3) for periodic boundary crossings
            for each atom. Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for cell list construction.
        atom_to_cell_mapping : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (total_atoms, 3) for cell coordinates for each atom.
            Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for cell list construction.
        atoms_per_cell_count : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (max_total_cells,) for number of atoms in each cell.
            Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for cell list construction.
        cell_atom_start_indices : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (max_total_cells,) for starting index in
            cell_atom_list for each cell. Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for
            cell list construction.
        cell_atom_list : jax.Array, optional
            Pre-shaped array of shape (total_atoms,) for flattened list of atom
            indices organized by cell. Can be provided to hint buffer reuse to XLA for
            cell list construction.
        max_atoms_per_system : int, optional
            Maximum number of atoms per system. Used in batch naive implementation
            with PBC. If not provided, it will be computed automatically.
            Can be provided to avoid CUDA synchronization.
        return_distances : bool, default=False
            Also return per-pair distances ``|r_ij|``, differentiable w.r.t.
            positions (and cell). Matrix layout is
            ``(num_rows, max_neighbors)``, where ``num_rows`` is
            ``total_atoms`` normally and ``len(target_indices)`` for partial
            lists; flat COO layout is ``(num_pairs,)``.
        return_vectors : bool, default=False
            Also return per-pair displacement vectors ``r_ij``, differentiable
            w.r.t. positions (and cell). Matrix layout is
            ``(num_rows, max_neighbors, 3)`` or flat COO ``(num_pairs, 3)``.
        rebuild_flags : jax.Array, optional
            Boolean flags selecting which systems to re-enumerate; systems whose
            flag is ``False`` keep their previous output.

    Note
    ----
    ``pair_fn`` is supported by the JAX bindings for single-cutoff neighbor
    lists. The naive and atom-centric cell-list paths use JAX kernel wrappers,
    while tiled paths use ``jax_callable``. Cluster-tile pair outputs are
    limited to CUDA float32 eligible systems; COO pair outputs on that path are
    eager-only. ``target_indices`` is supported by naive and cell-list paths,
    including batched naive/cell-list and low-level cell-list query wrappers,
    with compact target rows. The ``pair_centric`` strategy and cluster-tile
    methods reject ``target_indices``; use ``atom_centric`` for equivalent
    filtered cell-list results.

    Returns
    -------
    results : tuple of jax.Array
        Variable-length tuple depending on input parameters. The return pattern follows:

        **Single cutoff:**
          - No PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors)``
          - No PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr)``
          - With PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, neighbor_matrix_shifts)``
          - With PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list, neighbor_ptr, neighbor_list_shifts)``

        **Dual cutoff:**
          - No PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix1, num_neighbors1, neighbor_matrix2, num_neighbors2)``
          - No PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list1, neighbor_ptr1, neighbor_list2, neighbor_ptr2)``
          - With PBC, matrix format: ``(neighbor_matrix1, num_neighbors1, neighbor_matrix_shifts1, neighbor_matrix2, num_neighbors2, neighbor_matrix_shifts2)``
          - With PBC, list format: ``(neighbor_list1, neighbor_ptr1, neighbor_list_shifts1, neighbor_list2, neighbor_ptr2, neighbor_list_shifts2)``

        **Components returned:**

        - **neighbor_data** (array): Neighbor indices, format depends on ``return_neighbor_list``:

            - If ``return_neighbor_list=False`` (default): Returns ``neighbor_matrix``
              with shape (num_rows, max_neighbors), dtype int32, where
              ``num_rows`` is ``total_atoms`` normally and ``len(target_indices)``
              for partial lists. Row ``r`` contains neighbors for atom ``r`` or
              ``target_indices[r]`` respectively.
            - If ``return_neighbor_list=True``: Returns ``neighbor_list`` with shape
              (2, num_pairs), dtype int32, in COO format [source_rows, target_atoms].
              With ``target_indices``, source rows are compact row ids.

        - **num_neighbor_data** (array): Information about the number of neighbors for each atom,
          format depends on ``return_neighbor_list``:

            - If ``return_neighbor_list=False`` (default): Returns ``num_neighbors`` with shape (num_rows,), dtype int32.
              Count of neighbors found for each atom.
            - If ``return_neighbor_list=True``: Returns ``neighbor_ptr`` with shape (num_rows + 1,), dtype int32.
              CSR-style pointer arrays where ``neighbor_ptr_data[i]`` to ``neighbor_ptr_data[i+1]`` gives the range of
              neighbors for row i in the flattened neighbor list.

        - **neighbor_shift_data** (array, optional): Periodic shift vectors, only when ``pbc`` is provided:
          format depends on ``return_neighbor_list``:

            - If ``return_neighbor_list=False`` (default): Returns ``neighbor_matrix_shifts`` with
              shape (num_rows, max_neighbors, 3), dtype int32.
            - If ``return_neighbor_list=True``: Returns ``unit_shifts`` with shape
              (num_pairs, 3), dtype int32.

        When ``cutoff2`` is provided, the pattern repeats for the second cutoff with interleaved
        components (neighbor_data2, num_neighbor_data2, neighbor_shift_data2) appended to the tuple.

    Examples
    --------
    Single cutoff, matrix format, with PBC::

        >>> nm, num, shifts = neighbor_list(pos, 5.0, cell=cell, pbc=pbc)

    Single cutoff, list format, no PBC::

        >>> nlist, ptr = neighbor_list(pos, 5.0, return_neighbor_list=True)

    Dual cutoff, matrix format, with PBC::

        >>> nm1, num1, sh1, nm2, num2, sh2 = neighbor_list(
        ...     pos, 2.5, cutoff2=5.0, cell=cell, pbc=pbc
