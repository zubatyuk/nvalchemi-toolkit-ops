# Groups are declared as a name plus the pytest arguments for that name, rather

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The pull-request suite
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 56 test files out of 113, chosen by tools/group_coverage.py: at each step it
# takes the file with the best ratio of newly-covered statements to seconds,
# until the selection clears the coverage gate. That reaches 73.4% against a 70%
# threshold, for 36 minutes of the full suite's four and a half hours.
#
# The selection drops the expensive multipole PME and API tests on its own, not
# by hand: they cost minutes each, because Warp compiles a kernel specialised per
# (spline order, l_max, dtype), and they walk lines their cheaper siblings
# already cover. The nightly tier still runs them.
#
# Regenerate with `make minimal-suite-report` when a module gains behaviour the
# selected files do not exercise. Do not hand-edit these lists without re-running
# it — the point of them is that they are measured, not guessed.
