# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Added fixed-capacity ``jax.jit`` support to the method-specific JAX neighbor
  APIs. Naive and cell-list methods, including batched variants, accept
  ``coo_capacity`` for padded COO output with clipped pointers, raw required row
  counts, and a scalar launch-metadata validity flag. Batched pair-centric
  cell-list calls additionally need static launch metadata under ``jax.jit``.
  Invalid static launch relationships raise before the CUDA query, while runtime
  metadata mismatches invalidate the returned counts.
  ``neighbor_list`` performs eager orchestration, and compact COO output uses
  eager shape compaction.
- JAX dual-cutoff neighbor APIs now reject reversed cutoffs. Naive methods
  require ``cutoff2 >= cutoff1`` and cluster-tile methods require
  ``cutoff2 >= cutoff``; equal cutoffs remain valid.
- JAX DFT-D3 now accepts `D3Parameters` directly as a runtime argument to
  `jax.jit`, without unpacking and reconstructing its parameter arrays.
- Raised the minimum supported Warp version to 1.15 and migrated JAX bindings
  from Warp's removed experimental JAX module to its public JAX API, restoring
  compatibility with `warp>=1.15`.
- Warp initialization now retains warning-level diagnostics instead of
  suppressing all Warp log output.
- CUDA tiled direct-Warp multipole launchers now require caller-owned,
  operation-specific scratch bundles. PyTorch bindings allocate and retain this
  scratch internally, so their public APIs are unchanged; CPU direct-Warp paths
  do not require scratch.
- PyTorch segmented operations now accept int64 segment indices whose values
  fit in int32; these inputs are converted to int32 internally.

### Added

- `TileBufferOverflow` reports how many cluster-tile pairs were required, how
  many the buffer could hold, and which system overflowed a segmented batch.
  Torch `cluster_tile_neighbor_list` and JAX `build_cluster_tile_list`,
  `batch_build_cluster_tile_list`, `cluster_tile_neighbor_list`, and
  `batch_cluster_tile_neighbor_list` now accept `max_tiles_per_group`.

### Changed

- Differentiable Torch cluster-tile matrix geometry is returned independently
  from reusable output buffers. Supplied buffers receive detached value
  snapshots and remain non-differentiable storage.
- Torch cluster-tile compact COO outputs are now trimmed to the actual pair
  count. Requested distances and vectors are returned with the topology, so
  callers no longer need to provide geometry buffers. If reusable buffers are
  supplied, their active portions receive detached value snapshots, while the
  returned tensors use separate storage, with differentiable geometry when
  reconstruction is required.
- Compact batched Torch cluster-tile scratch now sums the capacity required by
  each system instead of sizing every group against the total batch group count.
  The resulting tile storage remains pooled across the batch.
- Eager Torch and JAX cluster-tile neighbor-list calls now raise
  `TileBufferOverflow` when tile-pair construction exceeds the allocated
  capacity. For cluster-tile calls, `NeighborOverflowError` identifies an
  undersized final matrix or COO buffer.
- Compiled JAX cluster-tile calls that allocate tile-index storage now require
  `max_tiles_per_group` to be a positive static Python integer. Complete
  caller-supplied tile-index storage determines capacity without that factor.
  Compiled calls do not raise `TileBufferOverflow`.
- Torch and JAX Ewald now expose caller-retained reciprocal Miller topology via
  `generate_ewald_miller_indices(...)` and
  `k_vectors_from_miller_indices(...)`. Full `ewald_summation(...)` accepts
  keyword-only `miller_indices=` and materializes Cartesian reciprocal vectors
  from the current cell. Both backends provide
  `ewald_reciprocal_space_from_miller_indices(...)` for the reciprocal
  component. This avoids rebuilding the integer index grid while preserving
  the reciprocal vectors' dependence on the current cell.

### Changed

- Torch matrix-to-COO conversion now supports `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)`
  when the output edge count changes. Torch extras now require PyTorch >=2.10.

### Fixed

- Torch bindings now launch Warp work on the current PyTorch CUDA stream across
  neighbors, dynamics, dispersion, electrostatics, spline, and math operations.
  This prevents Warp from observing unfinished Torch inputs, Torch from
  consuming incomplete Warp outputs, and Torch temporary storage from being
  reused while Warp still references it. JAX bindings continue to use
  XLA-provided streams through Warp's JAX adapters.
- Corrected the multipole Ewald/PME uniform-background coefficient for
  non-neutral cells. Split Ewald, PME, and cached Ewald now use the same
  zero-mode convention as the direct reciprocal calculation, including charge
  and cell derivatives.
- Segmented sums no longer retain CUDA graph-pool allocations through cached Warp
  launches when used from compiled PyTorch custom operators.
- Fixed JAX autodiff through `ewald_reciprocal_space(...)` when `k_vectors`
  are derived from the differentiated cell. The custom JVP previously
  discarded the `k_vectors` tangent and omitted the reciprocal-cell
  contribution to the cell gradient. It now differentiates through the
  supplied JAX graph, matching Torch. Cartesian vectors remain fixed only when
  they have zero tangent in the active JAX transformation, for example when
  precomputed from a reference cell or passed through
  `jax.lax.stop_gradient(k_vectors)`. Full
  `ewald_summation(k_vectors=...)` semantics are unchanged.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Monopole Torch and JAX Ewald, PME, and slab entry points accept keyword-only
  `energy_reduction="atom" | "system"` (default `"atom"`). `"atom"` returns
  per-atom energies `(N,)`; `"system"` returns per-system totals `(B,)`.
  Direct-output fields (forces, charge gradients, virials) keep their existing
  shapes. Torch eager atom mode may synchronize once per participating component
  when a materialized uniform cotangent is proven by value inspection; system
  mode is structurally sync-free for arbitrary `(B,)` loss weights. JAX adds
  API/layout parity only; underlying Warp kernels remain atom-buffer-oriented.
- PyTorch cluster-tile selective calls can append caller-owned tile state with
  `return_state=True`, without changing the default neighbor-list return arity.

### Changed

- Improved JAX neighbor-list import performance by deferring dtype-specific
  direct naive and cell-list Warp wrapper registration until first use.
  Cluster-tile graph callbacks now use bundled callback/preload registrations
  with lazy direct kernels for naive and cell-list paths. Public behavior is
  unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed Torch PME and Ewald energy gradients for connected charge, position, and
  cell inputs. Non-uniform or weighted energy losses and `create_graph=True`
  higher-order derivatives no longer double-count upstream chain-rule terms.
- Torch `ewald_reciprocal_space` now preserves graph-connected reciprocal
  vectors for cell/strain autograd, restoring the physical reciprocal Ewald
  virial when vectors are regenerated from the differentiable cell.
- Torch Ewald, PME, and slab backward paths now compile when an explicit
  single-system batch (`batch_idx=zeros(N)`) is supplied. Reciprocal PME
  compiled gradients are also correct when a compiled function is reused across
  mesh sizes.
- Torch DFT-D3 custom operators now zero caller-owned energy, forces,
  coordination-number, and virial buffers before empty-system or zero-edge
  early returns, so reused output tensors cannot retain stale values.
- JAX DFT-D3 CSR calls with atoms but no edges return zero-filled per-atom
  forces and coordination numbers with shapes `(N, 3)` and `(N,)`, matching
  the neighbor-matrix contract and preserving per-system energy and virial axes.
- JAX cell-list builds now derive search radii from their realized grids,
  preventing missed neighbors when static capacity changes the constructed
  grid. Batched `capacity_strategy="geometry"` preserves promoted grids for
  all non-empty systems by reserving an equal per-system capacity; volume-based
  sizing remains the default. Fused Warp graph calls with explicit
  `max_total_cells` now require an explicit `neighbor_search_radius`.
- Unbatched JAX naive dual-cutoff PBC neighbor lists now populate both cutoff
  outputs when using the default `wrap_positions=True`. Previously this path
  wrapped positions but skipped the fill kernel, leaving zero counts and padded
  matrices.
- Batched PyTorch cluster-tile segmented COO validates fixed topology, offsets,
  counts, and tile-state capacities before launching Warp kernels.
- Single-system Torch and JAX segmented cluster-tile COO now require one exact
  physical interval, bound writes by output capacity, fail closed for malformed
  offsets, and cap compiled/JIT active counts to writable capacity. Batched
  per-system physical subsegments remain supported.
- Compiled unified PyTorch cluster-tile dispatch now rejects tensor-valued PBC
  rather than treating it as fully periodic. Eagerly validate PBC and compile the
  direct single-system fixed-state route instead.
- JAX cluster-tile empty selective rebuilds now preserve false-flag state and
  clear true-flag pair and tile counts while retaining fixed-capacity storage.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- FIRE and FIRE2 optimizer steps accept caller-supplied per-system reductions
  via a `compute_reductions=True` flag (`fire_step`, `fire_update`,
  `fire2_step`, `fire2_update`, and the Torch `fire2_step_coord` /
  `fire2_step_coord_cell`). When `False`, the values already in `vf`/`vv`/`ff`
  (and FIRE2 `v_sumsq`/`f_sumsq`) are used for the mixing and dt/alpha update
  instead of being recomputed; the per-atom state roll-back still runs. Adds a
  standalone `fire_compute_vf_vv_ff` reduction helper. Default `True` is
  byte-identical to previous behavior.
- FIRE2 exposes its phases so a caller can post-process the displacement clamp
  threshold between the velocity mix and the clamp: `fire2_apply_step` (Warp)
  and the Torch `fire2_step_coord_cell_mix` / `_couple` / `_apply` split
  `fire2_step_coord_cell` into reduce+mix, measure-`max_norm`, and clamp+apply
  phases. `fire2_reduce` (Warp) and `fire2_compute_extended_reductions` (Torch,
  returning separate owned-atom and replicated-cell contributions) expose the
  reductions standalone. All default paths remain byte-identical.
- Full Torch Ewald/PME APIs support energy-derived forces, charge
  gradients, and strain-first virials, including second-order force/stress
  losses.
- 2D slab (Yeh-Berkowitz) correction for Ewald and PME summation, exposed as
  `compute_slab_correction` and a `slab_correction=` keyword on the Ewald/PME
  entry points, with both Torch and JAX bindings.
- Torch slab correction participates in autograd when inputs require
  gradients.
- Full JAX Ewald/PME energy-only calls support first-order gradients for
  positions, charges, and row-vector displacement virials.
- JAX PME reciprocal higher-order support is limited to tested position and
  charge scalar losses. PME cell/stress/strain higher-order derivatives remain
  unsupported.
- Torch Ewald accepts `miller_bounds` for k-vector generation.
- Torch/JAX PME accept precomputed `cell_inv_t`, `volume`, and B-spline
  moduli where supported.
- `compute_bspline_moduli_1d` is exported from the top-level Torch and JAX
  electrostatics namespaces for PME precompute workflows.
- Electrostatics autograd documents `positions`, `charges`, and `cell` as
  the only gradient targets. Setup values such as `alpha` are constants, and
  cell-derived reciprocal caches are static metadata assumed to correspond to
  the current cell.
- Higher-order electrostatics support is exposed through framework autograd on
  scalar losses; no public Hessian or Jacobian tensor/function APIs were added.

### Fixed

- Torch PME fused-convolve backward returned `grad_k_squared` with the wrong
  rank for a single system (4D for a 3D input, because `mesh_fft` keeps the
  batch dim while `k_squared` is squeezed). Eager masked it via autograd
  `sum_to_size`, but `torch.compile` — which trusts the op's fake shape — hit an
  `assert_size_stride` in the compiled backward when differentiating the
  reciprocal energy w.r.t. the cell. The `k_squared` unsqueeze is now tracked
  independently of the mesh and squeezed back on return, in both
  `_pme_convolve_backward` and `_pme_convolve_double_backward`.
- Batched pressure kinetic tensor (`compute_kinetic_tensor` /
  `compute_pressure_tensor` with `batch_idx`) is now computed with a per-atom
  atomic reduction. The previous tiled reduction summed each thread block as a
  whole and attributed it to a single system, corrupting per-system kinetic
  tensors whenever a block spanned more than one system.
- Cell-list size estimation no longer overflows when a cell is large relative
  to the cutoff: the per-dimension cell-count product is now computed
  overflow-safe (int64) and clamped per system, so `estimate_cell_list_sizes` /
  `estimate_batch_cell_list_sizes` always return a positive, capped count
  instead of a negative one that crashed `allocate_cell_list`. The estimate
  wrappers and `allocate_cell_list` (Torch and JAX) also validate the count and
  raise a clear error on a bad value.
- `estimate_max_neighbors` exposes a `max_neighbors_lower_bound` keyword
  (default 16) so callers can raise the floor for dense or clustered systems
  where short cutoffs underestimate the neighbor count (#114). Its
  `safety_factor` argument is deprecated (it scaled the estimate identically to
  `atomic_density`); it now emits a `DeprecationWarning` and is folded into
  `atomic_density`.
- Naive PBC neighbor wrapping now leaves non-periodic axes unwrapped when
  per-axis `pbc` flags are supplied, fixing partial-PBC and non-periodic
  systems (#104).
- Fixed Torch Ewald gradients for non-uniform per-atom energy cotangents
  (`torch.autograd.grad(..., grad_outputs=w)`).
- Batched JAX Ewald autodiff no longer materializes a
  systems-by-k-vectors-by-atoms phase tensor, avoiding excessive reciprocal-space
  memory use without changing energies or derivatives.
- JAX electrostatics no longer import the removed `jax.custom_transpose`. The
  Ewald/PME real- and reciprocal-space and slab HVP transpose rules are
  migrated to `jax.custom_vjp` (a stable API), restoring importability on
  current JAX (0.10+) while preserving the second-order (force/stress-loss)
  derivatives.
- Coupled the FIRE2 variable-cell updates so positions and cell degrees of
  freedom advance consistently during constrained/variable-cell relaxation.
- Neighbor-list launchers now reject unbatched methods when batch metadata is
  supplied, instead of silently producing incorrect lists.
- **MTK NPT/NPH cell propagation**: kernels wrote `V·(P − P_ext)/W`
  (strain-rate units) into `cell_velocity` while consumers read it as
  `ḣ = dh/dt`, costing a factor of cell length in the cell response.
  `cell_velocity` is now the strain rate `ε̇ = p_g/W` everywhere and
  the cell update is `h_new = h + dt · ε̇ · h`.
- **MTK velocity-half-step coupling**: isotropic kernels used
  `α = 1 + 1/(3N_atoms)` instead of the canonical
  `α = 1 + 1/N_atoms` (ASE `IsotropicMTKNPT._integrate_p`).
  Anisotropic and triclinic kernels used `(1 + 1/N_atoms)·ε̇`,
  which only matches ASE `MTKNPT._integrate_p` for uniform strain;
  replaced with `ε̇ + Tr(ε̇)/(3·N)·I` (canonical trace correction).
- **MTK barostat half-step thermostat coupling**: NPT
  cell-velocity-update kernels applied `−η̇₁·ε̇` inline, mixing the
  pressure/kinetic driving operator with NHC drag. Removed; callers
  apply barostat-NHC coupling separately, matching ASE and TorchSim.

### Deprecated

- Direct-output flags on full Torch and JAX Ewald/PME APIs are deprecated for
  differentiable training: `compute_forces`, `compute_virial`,
  `compute_charge_gradients`, and `hybrid_forces`. They remain available and keep
  the existing tuple order. Component `compute_forces=True` remains available for
  no-autograd MD/inference use; component charge-gradient, virial, and hybrid
  direct outputs warn as legacy training-style outputs.
- `nvalchemiops.neighbors.zero_array` now emits a `DeprecationWarning` and
  forwards to `array.zero_()`. Call `array.zero_()` directly.
- `cells_inv` argument on `compute_cell_kinetic_energy`,
  `npt_velocity_half_step{,_out}`, `npt_position_update{,_out}`,
  `nph_velocity_half_step{,_out}`, `nph_position_update{,_out}`,
  `run_npt_step`, and `run_nph_step`. Kernels consume
  `cell_velocities` directly as the strain rate `ε̇ = p_g/W`. Passing
  `cells_inv` emits a `DeprecationWarning`; the argument will be
  removed in a future release.
- `volumes` argument on `compute_cell_kinetic_energy`,
  `npt_velocity_half_step{,_out}`, and `nph_velocity_half_step{,_out}`.
  Kernels consume `cell_velocities` directly as the strain rate and
  no longer need a volume fallback. Passing `volumes` emits a
  `DeprecationWarning`; the argument will be removed in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

- `cell_velocities` now stores the strain rate `ε̇ = p_g/W`, not
  `ḣ = dh/dt`. Kernel signatures unchanged.
- `npt_barostat_half_step{,_aniso,_triclinic}` drop the `eta_dots`
  argument; thermostat coupling is now a separate Trotter operator.
- The internal `make_outer_neigh_offsets` helper was removed.

### Added (neighbors)

- **Pair potentials evaluated inline**: neighbor kernels now accept a
  user-supplied `pair_fn` callback (with `pair_params`, `pair_energies`,
  `pair_forces` buffers) that computes per-pair energy and force as pairs
  are enumerated, so Lennard-Jones–style potentials no longer require a
  separate pass over the neighbor list.
- **Per-pair vectors and distances on demand**: `return_vectors` and
  `return_distances` keyword arguments return the separation vectors
  `r_ij` and Euclidean distances `|r_ij|` alongside the neighbor matrix,
  avoiding a manual recomputation downstream.
- **Cluster-pair tile algorithm**: a new CUDA strategy for large
  fully-periodic float32 systems. `neighbor_list` auto-selects it when
  it is eligible; pass `method="cluster_tile"` (or
  `"batch_cluster_tile"`) to force it. Supports dual cutoff in
  matrix format.
- **Partial rebuild for batched workflows**: callers can pass
  `rebuild_flags` to re-enumerate only the systems whose atoms have
  moved enough to need a fresh list; unchanged systems keep their
  previous output. Supported for matrix and segmented-COO outputs in
  both the JAX and PyTorch bindings.
- **JAX CUDA graph replay**: JAX neighbor-list builders accept a
  `graph_mode` keyword (`GraphMode`) to capture and replay the build as a
  CUDA graph, reducing per-step launch overhead in MD loops.

### Changed (neighbors)

- Restructured `nvalchemiops/neighbors/` into per-strategy subpackages:
  `naive/`, `cell_list/`, `cluster_tile/`, `rebuild/`. Public launchers
  live under `*/launchers.py`; strategy selection lives under
  `*/dispatch.py`.
- The flat compatibility modules `nvalchemiops.neighbors.{naive_dual_cutoff,
  batch_naive, batch_cell_list, batch_naive_dual_cutoff, rebuild_detection}`
  continue to re-export the new entry points with `DeprecationWarning`.
  (Note: `nvalchemiops.neighbors.naive` and `nvalchemiops.neighbors.cell_list`
  are now the canonical subpackages, not deprecated shims.)

### Added (electrostatics)

- Higher-order (multipole) electrostatics for charges, dipoles, and quadrupoles
  (l = 0, 1, 2): direct-k Ewald (`multipole_ewald_summation`), particle-mesh
  Ewald (`multipole_particle_mesh_ewald`), reciprocal- and real-space entry
  points, electrostatic feature extraction (`multipole_electrostatic_features`),
  and an SCF cache/step API for repeated evaluations on a fixed cell. Provided as
  Warp kernels and `nvalchemiops.torch` bindings, single-system and batched, with
  energies, forces, moment gradients, stress, and force-loss (`create_graph`)
  training; the forward and first-order backward are `torch.compile`-compatible.

### Added (segment ops)

- Differentiable segment operations: backward kernels for the segment-op
  reductions enable autograd through `nvalchemiops.segment_ops`, with Torch
  (`nvalchemiops.torch.segment_ops`) and JAX (`nvalchemiops.jax.segment_ops`)
  bindings, an autograd example (`examples/02_segment_ops_autograd.py`), user
  guide docs, and benchmarks.

### Changed

- DFT-D3 dispersion kernels optimized for improved performance.
- Loosened the PyTorch version requirement to widen compatible installs.
- Updated the CUDA backend extras (`torch-cu12`/`jax-cu12` and related
  optional dependencies).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-03-16

### Breaking Changes

- **PyTorch is now an optional dependency**: The previous PyTorch-based functionality
has been moved to a separate `nvalchemiops.torch` namespace. See the hosted documentation
for a detailed migration guide. Previous imports should still be supported, however
will issue deprecation warnings. The old interfaces will be removed in an upcoming
release.

### Added

- Framework-agnostic Warp kernel layer for all modules (neighbors, electrostatics,
  dispersion, math/spline) that operates directly on `warp.array` objects. A best
  effort to have interfaces that mirror their framework bindings is made, however
  due to differences in functionalities this may not always be possible.
- Thin PyTorch bindings in `nvalchemiops.torch.*` that wrap the Warp kernels.
- Deprecation warnings for old import paths to guide migration.
- JAX bindings in `nvalchemiops.jax.*` that wrap the Warp kernels, providing
  support for neighbor lists, DFT-D3 dispersion, electrostatics (Coulomb, Ewald,
  PME), and splines with `jax.jit` compatibility.
- GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics integrators with single-system and batched modes:
Velocity Verlet (NVE), Langevin (NVT), Nosé-Hoover Chain (NVT), NPT, NPH, and
Velocity Rescaling
- FIRE (Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine) geometry optimizer with adaptive timestep,
variable cell optimization, and cell filtering for constrained optimization
- Lennard-Jones potential with GPU-accelerated energy, force, and virial computation
integrated with neighbor lists
- Batch processing utilities (`nvalchemiops.batch_utils`) with support for both
`batch_idx` (ragged arrays) and `atom_ptr` (CSR format) including operations:
`batch_sum`, `batch_mean`, `batch_max`, `batch_min`, `batch_scale`,
`batch_normalize`, `batch_gather`, `batch_scatter`
- Cell manipulation utilities including volume calculation, inverse, wrapping,
alignment, and transformation
- SHAKE and RATTLE constraint algorithms for bond length constraints and rigid
molecules

## 0.2.0 - 2025-12-19

### Added

- Methods/kernels for computing electrostatic interactions
  - Includes direct Coulomb, Ewald, and particle mesh Ewald methods.
  - Some supporting math routines including spherical harmonics, spline
  evaluation, and Gaussian basis.
- New scripts in the `examples/electrostatics` folder that demonstrate
the new electrostatics interface.

### Changed

- Default behavior for `estimate_max_neighbors` is now more sensible
  - The default `atomic_density` value is changed from 0.5 to 0.35, which
  should provide better estimates of the maximum number of neighbors for
  most systems.
  - The rounding value has now been changed from the nearest power of 2
  to the nearest multiple of 16, which means the padding in neighbor
  matrices will be significantly lower and more realistic, as the prior
  behavior tended to significantly overpredict the maximum neighbor count.

### Fixed

- Issue #2 and #3 duplicate neighbors appearing in cell and batched cell lists.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-12-05

First release of the package
